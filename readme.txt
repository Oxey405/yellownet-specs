YELLOWNET SPECIFICATIONS
It is highly recommended that you use an edition software to edit this.
Personnally I use Obsidian (https://obsidian.md) with the Excalidraw extension.

USE EXCALIDRAW TO DRAW THE SCHEMAS ! And please provide the save file for those schemas !
When contributing check that :
- You used correct english
- You have been precise enough
- You are sure of the feasibility of what you wrote

READ THE WORK ALREADY DONE ! Remember : YELLOWNET IS A SIMPLE PROTOCOL!
